#👋 Hi, I am Akash

Welcome to my Portfolio!

Thanks for stopping by. This repository houses the source code for my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my journey in Computer Science, from my work in Distributed Systems and AI to my time at Arizona State University.

### 💭 Why I Built This
In a web ecosystem dominated by heavy frameworks, I wanted to take a step back and focus on **performance and fundamentals**.

While I work with complex stacks like Python, Cloud, and ML in my day job, I believe a portfolio should be instant and accessible. I stripped away the heavy dependencies to build a site that loads fast and gives me total control over every pixel and interaction. It’s my way of practicing the "Right Tool for the Job" philosophy.

### 🛠️ The Tech Stack
I kept it lightweight and efficient:

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for accessibility.
* **CSS3:** Modern styling using CSS Variables (no heavy pre-processors).
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Hand-written logic for animations and interactivity.
* **Deployment:** Hosted on Netlify for global edge delivery.

### 🧩 Credits & Inspiration
This project was originally forked from an open-source template to establish the core layout. However, I have significantly refactored the codebase, rewritten the logic, and customized the design to reflect my own brand and engineering standards.
